# InnovateIT - Programming Courses

## Overview
InnovateIT is a web application designed to promote a community offering programming courses for both beginners and advanced learners. The application features four distinct pages: Home, About Us, Courses, and Contact. The user interface is simple and easy to use, allowing users to register for 10 free courses, leave messages, and obtain various information about the available courses, including their prices, the reasons for taking them, and ways to contact the team for any questions or inquiries.

## Heuristic Principles
The application follows the 10 heuristic principles for user interface design:

#### *1. Visibility of System Status*:
The button in the Contact section changes color after being pressed, indicating that the system is functioning and reducing uncertainty. Users will know their message was sent successfully and will avoid pressing the button multiple times.

#### *2. Match Between System and Real World*:
The system communicates with users in their usual language, using familiar phrases, words, and concepts rather than system-oriented terms.

#### *3. User Control and Freedom*:
Users can personalize the background by choosing between a light theme (by pressing the sun icon in the navigation bar) or a dark theme (by pressing the moon icon in the navigation bar).

#### *4. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design*:
The content and visual design focus on essential elements, avoiding unnecessary distractions from the information the user truly needs.

#### *5. Consistency and Standards*:
User confusion is avoided by adhering to conventions from common platforms. Colors, fonts, images, and other visual elements are used uniformly.

#### *6. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use*:
The application is designed to adapt to different screen sizes (responsive design), providing an optimized browsing experience on any device. Users can navigate easily, efficiently, and enjoyably.

#### *7. Recognition Rather Than Recall*:
The need for user memorization is minimized by making objects, actions, and options visible. For instance, the navigation bar is present on all pages and is easily recognizable.

#### *8. Error Prevention*:
Instead of showing clear error messages, potential errors are prevented by eliminating confusing situations. For example, the form on the Home page provides examples of how to input the necessary data.

#### *9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors*:
The account creation form includes four text boxes for the username, email, password, and password confirmation. All fields must be completed, the email must be valid, the password must contain at least 8 characters, and the repeated password must match the first password. If these rules are followed, the text box border turns green. If not, the border turns red, and a message appears under the box, clearly indicating the problem and suggesting a solution.

#### *10. Help and Documentation*:
Providing a contact system for users to request assistance or give feedback about the website is essential. The Contact page includes a form for users to send messages and receive support if needed.
